    Initialize a new Camera object to control the Sony RX100-VII camera on the drone

    Attributes
    ----------
    camera : gphoto2.Camera
        The gphoto2 camera object.
    session_id : int
        The session id for the current session.
        This will start at 0 the first time pictures are taken on a given day.
        Will then increment by 1 for each session on a given day.
    image_id : int
        The image id for the current image.
        Starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each image taken.

    Methods
    -------
    capture_photo(path: str = f"{os.getcwd()}/images/")
        Capture a photo and save it to the specified path.
        The default path is the images folder in the current working directory.
        The file name will be the file format attribute.
        Returns the file name and the file path.
