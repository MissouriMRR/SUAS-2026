class Drone:
    """
    A drone for the state machine to control.
    This class is a wrapper around the dronekit Vehicle class,
    and will be passed around to each state.
    Data can be stored in this class to be shared between states.

    Attributes
    ----------
    address : str
        The address used to connect to the drone.
    baud : int | None
        The baud rate, or None to use the default.
    is_connected
    odlc_scan : bool
        A boolean to tell if the odlc zone needs to be scanned, used the
        first run and if odlc needs to be scanned any other time
    vehicle
    _vehicle : dronekit.Vehicle | None
        The Dronekit Vehicle object that controls the drone, or None if a connection
        hasn't been made yet.

    Methods
    -------
    __init__(connection_string: str) -> None
        Initialize a new Drone object, but do not connect to a drone.
    vehicle(self) -> dronekit.Vehicle
        Get the Dronekit Vehicle object owned by this Drone object.
    is_connected(self) -> bool
        Checks if a drone has been connected to.
    connect_drone(self) -> Awaitable[None]
        Connect to a drone.
    close(self) -> Awaitable[none]
        Close the owned DroneKit Vehicle object.
    def use_sim_settings(self) -> None:
        Modify the connection settings to connect to a simulated vehicle.
    def use_real_settings(self) -> None:
        Modify the connection settings to connect to a real vehicle.
